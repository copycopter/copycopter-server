Copycopter
==========

Copycopter is a service for editing the copy text of a Rails application.

Each Rails application has its own Project, connected by an API key.
Each piece of copy in a Project is a Blurb. Each Blurb has many Versions, which
track changes users make to copy.

Each Version is either draft or published. The most typical scenario is to
display published content in production, and draft in all other environments.

A developer can issue a deploy, which marks the latest Version of all Blurbs as
published.
